# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes foster clarity, collaboration, and iterative delivery across cross-functional teams. Our approach is built on principles of customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to how we plan, execute, and continuously improve our projects.

## Key Workflows

### Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle consists of five key phases, each with standardized templates and checklists:

1. **Initiation** - Define business needs, identify stakeholders, and establish success criteria
2. **Planning** - Define scope, allocate resources, establish milestones, and map dependencies
3. **Execution** - Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release** - Deploy to production, verify functionality, and communicate to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective** - Capture learnings, identify improvements, and track action items

Each phase is designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and continuous delivery of value.

## Roles and Personas

### Core Team Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)** - Coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, risks, and communications to ensure projects are delivered on time and within scope
- **Product Manager (PdM)** - Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success against customer and business value
- **Developers** - Implement features, collaborate on design and testability, and maintain high-quality code
- **QA/Testing** - Validate quality, ensure acceptance criteria are met, and perform both automated and manual testing
- **Stakeholders** - Provide inputs, approvals, and represent business interests throughout the project

Detailed responsibilities and goals for each role are documented to ensure ownership and accountability.

## Communication Strategies

### Regular Communication Cadence

- **Daily Standups** - Quick synchronization within delivery teams to share progress, identify blockers
- **Weekly Delivery Syncs** - Coordination between PM and PdM on status, priorities, and risks
- **Twice-weekly Team Standups** - For delivery teams as agreed upon
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates** - Regular briefings to maintain transparency and alignment

### Status Reporting

Weekly status updates include:
- Progress this week
- Next steps
- Risks & blockers
- Ask / decisions needed

### Escalation Paths

Clear escalation paths are defined for blockers and incidents:
- Team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
- Incident communication includes triage summary, actions being taken, expected timeline, and post-incident retrospectives

## Quality Assurance Practices

### Testing and Validation

- **Automated Testing** - Continuous integration with automated test suites
- **Manual Testing** - QA validation against acceptance criteria
- **Security Scanning** - Automated security scans as part of CI/CD pipeline
- **Code Reviews** - Peer review process for all code changes

### Deployment and Release

Pre-release requirements include:
- All acceptance criteria met and PRs merged
- Passing CI and security scans
- Release notes drafted
- Rollback/mitigation plan documented
- Smoke tests prepared

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deployment window scheduled (if needed)
- [ ] Backup or snapshot (if applicable)
- [ ] Deploy to staging and run smoke tests
- [ ] Deploy to production (automated pipeline preferred)
- [ ] Run post-deploy verifications
- [ ] Announce release to stakeholders and support

### Continuous Improvement

- **Retrospectives** - Conducted after each sprint, release, or important milestone
- **Action Items Tracking** - Clear owners, due dates, and success criteria for improvements
- **Metrics and Measurement** - Impact tracking to validate improvements
- **Blameless Culture** - Focus on learning and system improvements rather than individual blame
